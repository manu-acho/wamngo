# WAM DAO Platform - Admin Functionality & Database Coverage Analysis

## Executive Summary

The WAM DAO platform has a comprehensive database schema and service layer but **lacks admin UI controls** for content moderation, proposal/project editing, and deletion. While the governance system is functionally complete for end users, administrative oversight capabilities are missing.

## Current Database Coverage

### âœ… Complete Tables & Services
- **Users**: Full CRUD, wallet integration, reputation tracking
- **Proposals**: Create, read, vote casting, status tracking
- **Votes**: Complete voting system with stake amounts
- **Projects**: Project submissions, updates, metrics tracking
- **Token System**: Purchase tracking, staking positions
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive user actions, platform stats
- **Communications**: Contact forms with status management

### âœ… Well-Designed Features
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Status workflows (pending â†’ active â†’ passed/rejected)
- JSON metadata fields for extensibility
- Timestamp tracking for audit trails
- Decimal precision for financial amounts

## Critical Gaps: Missing Admin Functionality

### ðŸš¨ **Proposals Admin Controls**
**Missing:**
- Delete proposal API/UI
- Edit proposal content/details
- Admin override proposal status
- Bulk proposal management

**Current State:** Proposals can only be created and voted on. No moderation controls.

### ðŸš¨ **Projects Admin Controls**
**Missing:**
- Delete project API/UI
- Edit project details after creation
- Admin approval workflow for project submissions
- Project status management beyond submissions

**Current State:** Project submissions exist but no approval/rejection workflow implementation.

### ðŸš¨ **Role-Based Access Control**
**Missing:**
- Admin user roles/permissions in DB schema
- Authentication middleware for admin routes
- Role-based UI component rendering

**Current State:** No distinction between regular users and administrators.

### ðŸš¨ **Content Moderation**
**Missing:**
- Flag inappropriate content
- Admin review queues
- Content appeal process
- Automated moderation rules

## Database Schema Recommendations

### 1. Add Admin Roles Table
```sql
-- New table needed
CREATE TABLE admin_roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  wallet_address VARCHAR(42) UNIQUE,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'super_admin', 'moderator', 'reviewer'
  permissions JSONB,
  granted_by VARCHAR(42),
  granted_at TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

### 2. Add Audit Log Table
```sql
-- New table needed
CREATE TABLE admin_actions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  admin_wallet VARCHAR(42),
  action_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'delete_proposal', 'edit_project', etc.
  target_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'proposal', 'project', 'user'
  target_id UUID,
  reason TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3. Extend Existing Tables
```sql
-- Add to proposals table
ALTER TABLE proposals ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE proposals ADD COLUMN deleted_by VARCHAR(42);
ALTER TABLE proposals ADD COLUMN delete_reason TEXT;

-- Add to projects table  
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN deleted_by VARCHAR(42);
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN delete_reason TEXT;
```

## Required API Routes

### Missing Admin Endpoints
```
PUT /api/admin/proposals/[id]     # Edit proposal
DELETE /api/admin/proposals/[id]  # Soft delete proposal
PUT /api/admin/proposals/[id]/status # Override proposal status

PUT /api/admin/projects/[id]      # Edit project
DELETE /api/admin/projects/[id]   # Soft delete project
PUT /api/admin/projects/[id]/approve # Approve project submission

GET /api/admin/dashboard          # Admin dashboard data
GET /api/admin/audit-log          # Admin action history
```

## Required UI Components

### 1. Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- Proposals pending review
- Project submissions queue
- Recent user activity
- Platform statistics

### 2. Proposal Admin Controls
- Edit proposal details
- Change proposal status
- Delete with reason
- View voting history

### 3. Project Admin Controls
- Approve/reject submissions
- Edit project information
- Manage project status
- Delete projects

### 4. User Management
- View user profiles
- Manage user permissions
- Ban/unban users

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Requirements
- Admin route middleware to verify wallet permissions
- Multi-signature requirements for critical actions
- Session management for admin users

### Data Protection
- Soft deletes to preserve audit trails
- Encrypted admin action logs
- Rate limiting on admin endpoints

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical)
1. Add admin roles to database schema
2. Create admin authentication middleware
3. Build basic admin dashboard
4. Implement proposal edit/delete functionality

### Phase 2 (Important)
1. Project approval workflow
2. User management interface
3. Audit logging system
4. Content moderation tools

### Phase 3 (Enhancement)
1. Automated moderation rules
2. Analytics dashboards
3. Bulk operations
4. Advanced permissions system

## Conclusion

The current database schema is **well-designed and comprehensive** for a DAO platform. The governance system has all necessary tables and relationships. However, **administrative oversight capabilities are completely missing**, creating potential security and moderation risks.

**Immediate Action Required:**
- Implement admin authentication system
- Add proposal/project editing capabilities
- Create basic admin dashboard for content moderation

The foundation is solid; adding admin functionality would complete the platform's readiness for production deployment.
