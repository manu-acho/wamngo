## 1. Introduction: The Problem We Solve

### 1.1 Global Challenges

Women worldwide face systemic barriers that limit their access to:
- **Healthcare**: 412 maternal deaths per 100,000 births in underserved regions
- **Economic Opportunities**: Women farmers receive 40% less agricultural advice
- **Digital Inclusion**: 5M+ women lack access to digital empowerment services
- **Recovery Support**: Limited reconstruction options for FGM survivors

### 1.2 Traditional NGO Limitations

Current humanitarian funding mechanisms suffer from:
- **Opacity**: Donors cannot track fund allocation in real-time
- **Centralization**: Top-down decision making without community input
- **Inefficiency**: High administrative overhead and slow deployment
- **Limited Scale**: Restricted reach due to funding constraints

### 1.3 The WAM Solution

WAM bridges this gap by combining:
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Real-time fund tracking and verified impact
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making through DAO structure
- **AI-Powered Innovation**: Technology solutions tailored for women's needs
- **Educational Rewards**: Community benefits instead of financial returns
