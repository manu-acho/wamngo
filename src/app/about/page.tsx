                <strong>I wish to extend my sincere thanks to those who helped me to create in such a short time Women Against Mutilation (WAM).</strong>

                I have worked for twenty years on the crucial question of the identity of migrant women. Active with several associations and groups, I have always been sensitive to the issue of female genital mutilation (FGM) and milit√©e to break this taboo. I thus directly involved in information, training and advice, both from civil society and various state commissions.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Complications of FGM are many and the people involved do speak little or no. These complications may differ depending on the type of circumcision according to WHO and the way it is practiced. Besides the immediate death after childbirth, the most common consequences are heavy bleeding during surgery, severe pain during menstruation, urinary infections or recurrent inability to hold urine.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                There are often complications during healing (cyst and abscess formation). The effects can be lost or decreased sexual sensitivity and pain preventing the woman to have a fulfilling sex life. Other possible consequences of FGM are deteriorating sexual pleasure of men and, in general, intimate relations between man and woman.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                It is important to note the existence of psychic disorders related to FGM: strong anguish, shock, psychological trauma. And long-term depression, sleep disorder, panic attacks, memory loss.
